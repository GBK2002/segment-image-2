# SAM2 Real-Time Object Tracking (Modified Fork)

This repository is a modified fork of [Meta's Segment Anything 2 (SAM2)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2), tailored to support real-time object segmentation from webcam input using SAM2.1.

## 🔍 About This Fork

This project includes:
- A fully functional real-time webcam object segmentation pipeline using SAM2.1.
- Support for the **standard SAM2.1 models** (`base_plus`, `small`, etc.).
- Experimental integration with the **Sierra-Tiny** lightweight model to reduce latency on edge devices.
- CUDA-accelerated frame processing with AMP (`autocast`) and threaded pipelines.

> **Note:** Work on the lightweight model (`sam2.1_hiera_tiny.pt`) is ongoing. Results are functional but not fully optimized for stability or accuracy.

## 🧠 Models Supported

| Model | Size | Performance | Status |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| `sam2.1_hiera_base_plus` | ✅ Full | High accuracy | ✅ Stable |
| `sam2.1_hiera_tiny`      | ✅ Small | Lower latency | ⚠️ Experimental |

Model checkpoints can be downloaded via:

```bash
# Example using curl
curl -L -o checkpoints/sam2.1_hiera_base_plus.pt https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/092824/sam2.1_hiera_base_plus.pt

# Tiny model (not yet optimized)
curl -L -o checkpoints/sam2.1_hiera_tiny.pt https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/092824/sam2.1_hiera_tiny.pt
```

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sam2.git
cd sam2
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install opencv-python torch torchvision torchaudio tqdm hydra-core
```

### 3. Run Real-Time Segmentation

```bash
python live_cam_tiny.py
```

- Click on the webcam preview to select an object.
- SAM2 will segment and track the object across frames.

## 🧪 Known Issues (Tiny Model)

- The `sam2.1_hiera_tiny.pt` model loads with additional unused parameters, causing state dict mismatches.
- Some frame segments are unstable when switching between motion or occlusion.
- Optimization for CUDA Graphs is partially implemented but needs tuning for low-memory GPUs.

---

## 🛣️ Future Directions

- [ ] Implement strict model pruning to improve tiny model loading.
- [ ] Add temporal smoothing or optical flow assist for better tiny model tracking.
- [ ] Benchmark against standard models to quantify latency/performance tradeoffs.
- [ ] Deploy lightweight variant for mobile/IoT use cases.
